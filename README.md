This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.  Task 3 From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predicted the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.  Task 4 For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, created the Decision Tree classifier and visualized it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
